Morphological Transformations- https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_morphological_ops/py_morphological_ops.html 

Erosion- essentially erodes the boundry of the shape. Usefull for reducing small white noise in the image. It will erode away the small particles in the image leaving only major contours

Dilation- Often used after erosion. Since erosion makes our eroded object bigger again.

Thresholding- https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.0/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html

Thresholding- essentially if the pixel value is greater then a certain value it is assigned to a certain value and if it is less than that value it is assigned another value. So for binary thresholding if the pixel is say >50 it it is assigned to white or 1 if it is less than 50/ <50 it is assigned to black

Different Filters- https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d4/d13/tutorial_py_filtering.html

bilateral filter- highly effective noise removal filter while preserving edges

Canny- popular edge detection algorithm


FindContours refrence - https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html 

findContours-
Before applying findcontours you usually want to apply a threshold or canny edge detection

cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE-
When detecting contours your are essentially looking for points with the same intensity

WHAT cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE does is that it find only the necessary points to determine the contour and thus saves memory


What is a contour- 
A curve joining continuous points which all have the same color/intensity

approxPolyDP- approximates a polygonal curve with a specified precision

A polygonal curve is just a connected series of line segements

KeyWords
HVS - Human Visual system
Multi-channel filtering
Spatial Frequency- The spatial frequency is a measure of how often sinusoidal components (as determined by the Fourier transform) of the structure repeat per unit of distance. The SI unit of spatial frequency is cycles per meter.
Wavelet- one wave 
Spatial domain- manipulating pixels in an image directly
Frequency Domain- Transforming the image to its frequency representation
Kernal- A Kernel tells you how to change the value of any given pixel by combining it with different amounts of the neighboring pixels. The kernel is applied to every pixel in the image one-by-one to produce the final image (this operation known as a convolution).

Texture is periodically repeating patterns
People use texture properties to differentiate between textures
Three texture properties
Repetition
Direction
Complexity
Texture repetition can be categorized by 
Spatial frequency

Directionality by its orientation
Page 2
Gabor filter used extensively in texture segmentation due to the ability to
Tune to specific spatial frequency
Tune to specific orientation
Gabor Function is a sinusoidally modulated Gaussian
